The purpose of this repository is to house a set of jupyter notebooks demonstrating various signal processing concepts in code form. 

Why does the internet need yet another signal processing reference? 

  1. Practical signal processing, for example in industry, is an interactive discipline. As such, it is important that concepts be demonstrated in code as well as in math. Therefore this set of materials makes code central and math peripheral, flipping the priority of a traditional textbook.
  2. Algorithm efficiency doesn't matter as much in the era of deep learning. 
  3. As the domain of signal processing expands outside of com/radar, “systems” definition has expanded and is rarely captured by the 1-D time-series analysis of an LTI system.
